# PRTS Document
The PRTS document consists of three main parts. 

**The first part** is about how to use PRTS in your requirements, which includes an introduction to the basic structure of the PRTS project and the use of configuration files. Here we use a website backend requirement with Flask as the framework as an example. 

**The second part** is the documentation for all functions of PRTS, which is actually not very important because almost every function is annotated in the source code of PRTS, and even if you only refer to the annotations when writing code, PRTS can be used normally.

PRTS itself is almost ready to use out of the box, but if you want to expand or change the behavior of any part of it, you need to refer to **the third section** of the documentation. This section will teach you how to customize the sending facilities for verification codes and how to use the PRTS schedule.
